# `MultiNetEnrich` <img src="man/figures/logo_enrich.png" align="right" height="150"/>


The `MultiNetEnrich` package implements functional network enrichment analysis for multiple data sets. The method takes a list of data matrices with a one-to-one correspondence between the variables, such as different clinical groups or tissue types with the same set of genes measured, or mRNA and protein encoded by the same genes. The method has two steps; (i) network estimation and (ii) enrichment analysis based on the results. In step (i), we use the joint graphical horseshoe for multiple network estimation (@lingjaerde2022scalable) to obtain one network per group. The method borrows strength across shared patterns while highlighting differences across networks, giving a reasonable basis for comparisons. In step (ii), we use ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (@subramanian2005gene) on each network, where genes (or the proteins they encode) are ranked according to their node degree in the respective networks to identify gene sets that are over-represented by the most active or central genes or proteins in each group in terms of associations. To identify enriched gene sets, we walk through the ranked gene lists from top to bottom, investigating different gene sets and pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).

## Installation

This package requires the network estimation packages `fastGHS`and `jointGHS`, as well as the `GSEA` package to be installed. To install the current development version of all packages, use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("camiling/fastGHS")
remotes::install_github("camiling/jointGHS")
remotes::install_github("GSEA-MSigDB/GSEA_R")
remotes::install_github("camiling/MultiNetEnrich")
```

If you would like to install all packages of the models we currently support, use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("camiling/MultiNetEnrich", dependencies = TRUE)
```


If you would also like to build and view the vignette locally, use 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("camiling/MultiNetEnrich", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
browseVignettes("MultiNetEnrich")
```

You might need to run the script for GSEA manually once before the package can be used

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source(system.file('extdata', 'Run.GSEA.R', package = 'GSEA'))
```


## Example


The main function `MultiNetEnrich` takes a list of $K$ data matrices, each of dimension $n_k \times p$ where $n_k$ is the sample size of data set $k$, for which separate functional network enrichment is to be computed. Note that the column names must be gene names, so if you are using protein data please convert them to the id of the gene that encodes them. 



The following examples show how `jointGHS` identifies the common edges for a set of $K=2$ graphs, as well as the individual edges on the network-level, and returns the resulting precision matrix estimates. One example with $K=2$ data sets drawn from the same distribution, and one with $K=2$ data sets drawn from completely unrelated distributions, is shown. In the first case, jointGHS identifies a large number of common edges. This results in high precision considering the high dimensionality of the problem. In the latter case, hardly any common edges are found and little similarity between the two graphs is encouraged. 

The data is generated using the R package `huge` (@huge), as it includes functionality for generating data from a Gaussian graphical model. The networks we generate are *scale-free*, which is a known trait in many real-life networks such as genomic networks (@kolaczyk09).

```{r, warning = FALSE}
#  example 1: scale-free data where the data sets are from the same distribution
set.seed(123)
n1 <- 60 # let there be different number of samples in each data set
n2 <- 50
p <- 20 # Still very high-dimensional: 190 potential edges
dat <- huge::huge.generator(n = n1, d = p, graph = "scale-free")
dat$sparsity # true sparsity level
prec.mat <- dat$omega # the true precision matrix of both data sets
x1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n1, mu = rep(0, p), Sigma = dat$sigma) # data set 1
x2 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n2, mu = rep(0, p), Sigma = dat$sigma) # data set 2
Y <- list(x1, x2)
res <- jointGHS(Y, epsilon = 1e-3, AIC_eps = 1e-3)
adj.mat1 <- abs(cov2cor(res$theta[[1]])) > 1e-5 # the estimated adjacency matrix of graph 1
adj.mat2 <- abs(cov2cor(res$theta[[2]])) > 1e-5 # the estimated adjacency matrix of graph 2
sparsity(adj.mat1) # the sparsities of the estimated precision matrices
sparsity(adj.mat2)
# Look at precision of inferred graphs
precision(abs(prec.mat) > 1e-7, adj.mat1)
precision(abs(prec.mat) > 1e-7, adj.mat2)
# Save for plotting
adj.mat1.1 <- adj.mat1
adj.mat2.1 <- adj.mat2
# example 2: scale-free data where where the data sets are from completely unrelated distributions
set.seed(123)
n1 <- 60
n2 <- 50
p <- 20
dat1 <- huge::huge.generator(n = n1, d = p, graph = "scale-free")
dat2 <- huge::huge.generator(n = n2, d = p, graph = "scale-free") # second graph is completely unrelated
dat1$sparsity # true sparsity level for graph 1
dat2$sparsity # true sparsity level for graph 2
prec.mat1 <- dat1$omega # the true precision matrix of data set 1
prec.mat2 <- dat2$omega # the true precision matrix of data set 2
x1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n1, mu = rep(0, p), Sigma = dat1$sigma)
x2 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n2, mu = rep(0, p), Sigma = dat2$sigma)
Y <- list(x1, x2)
res <- jointGHS(Y, epsilon = 1e-3, AIC_eps = 1e-3)
adj.mat1 <- abs(cov2cor(res$theta[[1]])) > 1e-5 # the estimated adjacency matrix of graph 1
adj.mat2 <- abs(cov2cor(res$theta[[2]])) > 1e-5 # the estimated adjacency matrix of graph 2
sparsity(adj.mat1) # the sparsities of the estimated precision matrices
sparsity(adj.mat2) # Very sparse as little data is available, and no shared information
# slightly lower precision as no information could be borrowed across classes, but still very high
precision(abs(prec.mat) > 1e-7, adj.mat1)
precision(abs(prec.mat) > 1e-7, adj.mat2)

```

The resulting jointGHS graphs can be visualised with functions from the `network` and `ggnet2` libraries. 


```{r,fig.align='center', out.width='60%',results='hide',warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
net1 <- network::network(adj.mat1.1)
net2 <- network::network(adj.mat2.1)
g1 <- GGally::ggnet2(net1, alpha = 0.9, color = "darkblue")
g2 <- GGally::ggnet2(net2, alpha = 0.9, color = "darkblue")
ggpubr::ggarrange(g1, g2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```
